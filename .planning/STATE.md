# Project State: GSD Multi-User Monorepo Support

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Identity and Path Resolution Core** — In Progress (Plans 01-01, 01-02 complete, next: 01-03)

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Identity and Path Resolution Core | In Progress (2/3 plans) |
| 2 | Module Path Migration | Not Started |
| 3 | Project Lifecycle Commands | Not Started |
| 4 | Team Visibility and Hardening | Not Started |

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| lockIdentity writes `_schema:1` to user-map.json | 01-01 | Future-proofing schema evolution |
| resolveIdentity returns null on failure, never calls error() | 01-01 | Convention: utility functions return null, caller handles hard errors |
| sanitizeSlug delegates to generateSlugInternal + 30-char limit | 01-01 | Reuses existing core.cjs slug generation |
| Lazy require for context.cjs inside getPlanningRoot body | 01-02 | Avoids circular dependency: context.cjs requires core.cjs at top level |
| tryGetPlanningContext soft-resolves identity/context, hard-errors CI/CD and legacy | 01-02 | Init commands need graceful failure, but CI/CD and legacy are always fatal |
| ensureActiveGitignored is internal, not exported | 01-02 | Defensive safety mechanism, not a public API |
| GSD_PROJECT env var is transient (never persists to .active) | 01-02 | Env var overrides are runtime-only, not side-effecting |

## Session Log

| Date | Session | Activity |
|------|---------|----------|
| 2026-03-17 | Roadmap creation | Roadmap created with 4 phases covering 35 v1 requirements |
| 2026-03-17 | Phase 1 context | Context gathered — 4 areas discussed: identity resolution, active context, old structure detection, CI/CD behavior |
| 2026-03-23 | Phase 1 critique | 5 critics run, 3 critical blind spots identified |
| 2026-03-23 | Phase 1 context update | 3 blind spots resolved: concurrent writes (git handles), bootstrap (tryGetPlanningContext), migration (inline guidance) |
| 2026-03-24 | Plan 01-01 executed | identity.cjs + test helper + 14 tests — 3 min, 3 tasks, 3 files |
| 2026-03-24 | Plan 01-02 executed | context.cjs + getPlanningRoot + 22 tests — 4 min, 4 tasks, 4 files |
